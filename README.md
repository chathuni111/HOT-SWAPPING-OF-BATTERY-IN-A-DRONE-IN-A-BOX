# HOT-SWAPPING-OF-BATTERY-IN-A-DRONE-IN-A-BOX
Drone-in-a-Box (DIB) solutions are the systems that provide protection from environmental factors, as well as a safe place for recharging the UAV batteries, enabling fully remote operation of the drone.In this project , the main objectives were to design the locking and holding mechanism for the end effector on the battery with one/two actuators, the locking mechanism of the battery when the drone was flying, and fixing mechanism of the battery to the charging dock. The main considerations was the safety of the battery,adaptability for bad weather conditions(rains), reduction of battery heating and minimizing the downtime of drones. A novel mechanism and design for the end effector of the robot arm including drone cover,batterycover and the charging dock was introduced in this project.The project was supervised by Dr. P.B.Boyagoda - Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Dr. Kanishke Gamagedara - Robotics and Control Engineer, American Robotics
